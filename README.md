his project, developed for the course ENG 686X – Multi-Criteria Decision Making, explores optimal electricity generation strategies by evaluating three energy input options—imports, coal with carbon capture, and natural gas—under various environmental and economic objectives. Using tools such as nonlinear optimization, Pareto analysis, and additive value functions, the team assessed trade-offs between minimizing net costs, CO2 emission damages, and local pollution, while maintaining a fixed electricity demand. Techniques like the weighting and constraint methods were employed to generate non-dominated portfolios, and stochastic dominance analysis was used to further evaluate and compare options. The findings highlight how input choices vary based on policy preferences, providing decision-makers with actionable insights into sustainable energy planning.
